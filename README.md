# Representation Learning via Knowledge-Graph Embeddings and ConvNet (RLVECN).

This emperical model has been proposed for solving Link Prediction, Node Classification as well as Community Detection problems in Social Network Analysis (SNA).

Additionally, this repository contains implementation for the following Link Prediction benchmark models (or baselines): \
(1) ComplEx: Complex Embeddings for Simple Link Prediction [Trouillon et al., 2016] [Lacroix et al., 2018]. \
(2) ConvKB: A Novel Embedding Model for Knowledge Base Completion Based on Convolutional Neural Network [Nguyen et al., 2018]. \
(3) DistMult: Embedding Entities and Relations for Learning and Inference in Knowledge Bases [Yang et al., 2015]. \
(4) HolE: Holographic Embeddings of Knowledge Graphs [Nickel et al., 2016].
